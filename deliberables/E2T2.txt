Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

1. No bucket encryption

2. Passwords do not match IAM policy(higher risk of brute force)

3. No EBS volume encryption

4. Redirection to HTTPS is not supported.

5. Guardduty not enabled for Load Balancer

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

1. Use encryption of all data storages

2. Set up strong password policy

3. Accept only HTTPS Traffic(Load Balancer must accept only port 443
 and InternetGateway must redirect from port 80 to port 443)

4. Enable Guardduty
